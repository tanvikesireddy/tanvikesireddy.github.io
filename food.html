	<p align = "center"> Chicken Biryani is an authentic Indian dish. Hyderabadi biryani is Indiaâ€™s most famous biryani; some say biryani is 
	synonymous with Hyderabad. I love having biryani any day, any time. My friends and I order it every Saturday. 
	It has now become a ritual for us. I always ask the restaurant to make it extra spicy as I love it that way. 
	My mom make amazing Biryani and I'm missing that quite a lot these days.</p>
