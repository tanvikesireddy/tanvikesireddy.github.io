	<p style = "color: #ffffff" align = "center">Since I am immensely interested in art, let's talk about my favorite painting. The Starry Night is an oil-on-canvas painting by the Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh. It was painted in June 1889. The Starry Night is one of the most recognizable paintings in Western art. I have recently been to van Gogh'sart exhibition. I've seen almost all the beautiful paintings by him. 
	The Starry Night is one of a kind. The Starry Night is the only nocturne in the series of views from his bedroom window. The painting is now situated at the Museum of Modern Art, New York. I also love his other paintings:
